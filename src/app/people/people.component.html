    Everyone coming to Hack Cambridge will be added to our Slack
    channel so you can chat to the hackers. You will also be
    added to HELPq, a hackathon ticketing system. To do so we
    need to know who is coming in advance. Phone numbers will
    only be used if we need to contact you during the event
    urgently.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone can take part in deciding who gets the overall
    Hack Cambridge prizes. Judging will be done using Gavel, an
    expo judging system originally developed for HackMIT. Note
    that any competitions your company runs are separate and may
    be judged however you wish.

    You may bring an unlimited number of mentors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mentors are technically focused peopleâ€”software
    engineers, developers, or similar. Their primary concern is
    to help hackers with technical issues, though they may also
    discuss the your company and your products. We recommend
    sending developers whose expertise covers a wide range of
    technical areas, and certainly ones who are knowledgeable
    about any software or hardware you have listed with us. The
    most important thing a mentor should remember is to be
    proactive. Hackers will often be shy and reluctant to ask
    for help when they're having problems.
