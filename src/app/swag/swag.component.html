                    Let us know what swag you want to bring so we can plan ahead.
                    All swag requires approval simply to ensure we have a good
                    spread of swag rather than 10 of the same thing!

                    We have found that hackers tend to prefer a smaller number
                    of useful and good quality swag, rather than lots of small
                    or novelty items. Items in the past which went down well
                    include umbrellas, mugs, bags and powerbanks.
